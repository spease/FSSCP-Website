					<p>Welcome to the new page for the source code project! It's been awhile since we've had a website rather than a links page. Many thanks to Pyro MX, who came up with the site design for the new website.</p>
					<p>For those of you just joining us via Google, here's a brief introduction. The Source Code Project was started roughly five years ago, when Volition released the source code to the game known as "Freespace 2". This virtually unknown game consistently won awards for being a great action space sim, but never really caught on when it was released. The Source Code Project has worked, and continues to work, on improving the graphics and gameplay of this ten-year-old game. See the screenshots page; I think they pretty much speak for themselves</p>
					<p>Some of the larger projects in the Freespace community are <a href="http://babylon.hard-light.net/">The Babylon Project</a>, <a href="http://wmc.freespacemods.net/scpnew/mods.php?mod=Beyond%20the%20Red%20Line">Beyond the Red Line</a> (a Battlestar Galactica mod), and <a href="http://wmc.freespacemods.net/scpnew/mods.php?mod=Wing%20Commander%20Saga">Wing Commander Saga</a>. There's also a <a href="http://www.hard-light.net/wiki/index.php/Campaign_List">number of campaigns</a> both for these mods and the original game's storyline.</p>
					<p>Currently, the FSSCP is in between the 3.6.8 and 3.6.10 releases. You can find the SCP dev roadmap <a href="http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,48559.0.html">on the forums</a> to get an idea of what's coming up for 3.6.10. Some of the recent builds include <a href="http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,50258.0.html">normal mapping</a>, <a href="http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,54110.0.html">TrackIR support</a>, <a href="http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,54465.0.html">Radar and AI improvements</a>, and <a href="http://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php/topic,54045.0.html">camera/cutscene updates</a>.</p>
					<p>Finally, the forums tend to be the most active part of the project. So if you don't see any newsposts for awhile, check out the forums and skim some of the recent threads or recent builds to get a feel of what's going on.</p>
